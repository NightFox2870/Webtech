    <div class="detail">
        In 2011, <i>Tron</i> might look more than
        antiquated. Released at a time when the
        merging of computer effects and cinema was only in the beginning stages, the film might have visually dazzled a
        few decades ago but to say it looks
        rough by today's standards is indisputable. Still, movies like <i>Tron</i> and <i>The Last Starfighter</i></a> not only
        pioneered the effects most audiences
        take for granted anymore, they also did something that many of today's films fail to achieve: build the effects
        around the story, in these two cases
        stories with great characters, quality scripts, and a fair bit of heart. Those values carry a movie more than
        any other element, whether a film hails
        from the silent era; is one of the early talkies; was filmed in black and white; dazzles with stop-motion
        special effects; or now, is constructed on hard
        drives and computer screens. When, nearly 30 years after its release, a sequel to <i>Tron</i> was announced and
        subsequently hit theaters,
        interest was piqued but expectations
        were uncertain. <i>Tron</i> was a pioneering film, a picture with an important place in cinema history but also
        one with a unique look and feel
        that's
        so simple it might not really translate all that well into 21st century standards. How could the filmmakers
        possibly ramp things up and keep the
        world
        of <i>Tron</i> looking clean and simplistically efficient while still taking full advantage of the horsepower of
        today's films and, just as important,
        keep the storyline going and
        re-capture the essence of the original? Somehow, they accomplished all of it; <i>Tron: Legacy</i> is one of
        those rare special effects films that can
        have its cake and eat it too. The picture is a dazzling tour-de-force of visual wonders, but it's also a good
        bit entertaining and, more important, finds
        a soul that grounds the entire thing in basic human emotions, even in a world where the heartless digital reigns
        supreme.
